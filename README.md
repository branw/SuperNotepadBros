## Usage

This project has no dependencies and should compile in any Visual Studio 2019
version. To play, place `Loader.exe` and `SuperNotepadBros.dll` in the same
directory, then run `Loader.exe` (`SuperNotepadBros.dll` should be in the same
working directory). Note that the binaries need to have the same architecture
as `notepad.exe`, e.g. 64-bit Windows requires this project to be built for
the x64 platform.

Move your `I` around with the arrow keys, collecting all of the `Â£` until the
exit `e` opens into an `E`.

## TODO

- Figure out why enabling Word Wrap causes a crash
- Allow seamless level saving/loading
- Add more levels and reloading
- Add a level editor
